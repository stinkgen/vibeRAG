# Ingestion Module Rules

These rules apply to Python files in the `ingestion/` directory.

- Stick to the General Python Rules for all baseline standards.
- Use the `unstructured` library to parse PDFs, HTML, Markdown, and plain text files—handle every format like a boss.
- Extract metadata: title, author, and use `spaCy` to pull entities and keywords for extra juice.
- Detect language with `langdetect` so you know what the fuck you’re dealing with.
- Split text into 512-token chunks with a 50-token overlap—don’t lose context, bro.
- Return a list of dictionaries: each chunk gets its text and metadata (language, entities, etc.).
- Log the whole process—file types parsed, chunk counts, any errors.
- If a file won’t parse, log it and move on—no crashing allowed.
