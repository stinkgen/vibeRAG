# Vector Store Module Rules

These rules apply to Python files in the `vector_store/` directory.

- Stick to the General Python Rules for all baseline standards.
- Use `pymilvus` to connect to a local Milvus instance—keep it tight and secure.
- Set up a collection with fields: embeddings (float vectors), chunk IDs (int), metadata (text, language, etc.).
- Write functions for adding, updating, and deleting documents—CRUD all day.
- Support hybrid search (semantic + keyword) with Milvus’s scalar filtering.
- Log every operation—insertions, deletions, search calls, errors.
- Retry on connection fails—don’t let a hiccup kill the vibe.
