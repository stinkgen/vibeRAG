# Generation Module Rules

These rules apply to Python files in the `generation/` directory.

- Stick to the General Python Rules for all baseline standards.
- For "Chat with Knowledge": grab top-5 chunks, feed ‘em to the LLM with the query, return the response.
- For "Create Presentation": retrieve chunks, summarize with BART (`transformers`), structure into slides.
- Output presentations as JSON: `{ "slides": [{"title": "...", "content": "..."}] }`.
- Log the process—chunks used, summary steps, final output size.
- If no chunks match, return a "nothing found" message—keep it smooth.
