# Multi-Agent Research Rules

**Scope**: Applies to Python files in the `research/` directory (`research/*.py`).

## Core Rules
- Stick to the General Python Rules—type hints, docstrings, tests, all that jazz.
- Use `crewAI` to build a multi-agent system with three badasses:
  1. **Researcher**: Hits up Milvus for chunks via semantic or keyword search.
  2. **Analyzer**: Runs `spaCy` on chunks to dig out themes, entities, or patterns.
  3. **Synthesizer**: Summarizes with BART (`transformers`) into a report or paper.
- Define tight tasks and tools for each agent—no overlap, no chaos.
- Use CrewAI’s memory (short-term and long-term) to keep agents synced across runs.
- Log every agent’s moves—queries, outputs, collabs—like a play-by-play.
- Test the crew with a small query (e.g., “What’s up with AI ethics?”) before going ham.

## Environment Lock
- **ALL CODE RUNS IN `vibeRAG`. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
- If `crewAI`, `spaCy`, or `transformers` ain’t in `vibeRAG`, the agent says: “Install this shit with `conda install <package>` in `vibeRAG`.”

## Vibe Injection
- Researcher logs: “Found some gold in Milvus—check this out.”
- Analyzer comments: `# Slicing these chunks like a ninja—entities incoming`
- Synthesizer output: “Boom, here’s your report—clean and crispy.”
