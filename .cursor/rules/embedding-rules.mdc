# Embedding Module Rules

These rules apply to Python files in the `embedding/` directory.

- Stick to the General Python Rules for all baseline standards.
- Use `sentence-transformers` with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model—fast and solid embeddings.
- Check for GPU with `torch.cuda.is_available()`—use it if you got it, fall back to CPU if not.
- Batch process chunks for embeddings—don’t waste time on singletons.
- Log the embedding run: hardware used, batch sizes, time taken.
- Normalize embeddings for cosine similarity—Milvus eats that shit up.
- Store embeddings in a temp file if memory’s tight—don’t choke the system.
