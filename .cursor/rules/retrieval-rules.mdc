# Retrieval Module Rules

These rules apply to Python files in the `retrieval/` directory.

- Stick to the General Python Rules for all baseline standards.
- Use Milvus for semantic search—vector similarity all the way.
- Add keyword search with Milvus scalar filtering—exact matches when you need ‘em.
- Combine both into a hybrid search option—best of both worlds.
- Return top-5 chunks ranked by relevance—adjustable if needed.
- Log queries and results—see what’s hitting and what’s missing.
- Tweak Milvus params (e.g., index type) for speed—don’t sleep on optimization.
