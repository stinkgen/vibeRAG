# Frontend Rules

These rules apply to TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx) in the `frontend/` directory.

- Use TypeScript with strict mode—catch dumb errors early.
- Write functional components with hooks—no ancient class components.
- Define prop types with TS interfaces—keep it clear what’s coming in.
- Use `useState` or `useContext` for state—keep it simple and clean.
- Style with CSS modules—no global CSS messes.
- Break UI into reusable components—chat, search, presentation views.
- Write tests with `jest` and `react-testing-library`—test renders and interactions.
- Add JSDoc comments for components—explain what they do.
- Connect to FastAPI endpoints—`/chat`, `/search`, `/presentation`.
