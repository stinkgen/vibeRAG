# Implementation Review (vibeRAG)

This document reviews the implementation status of the vibeRAG application based on the code structure observed and documentation generated on [Date of Analysis - please fill in]. It compares the features described in `docs/frontend.md` and `docs/backend.md` with the existing components and API endpoints.

## Overall Summary

The core features described in the documentation (Chat, Document Management, Presentations, Research, Configuration) appear to be largely implemented, with corresponding frontend components and backend API endpoints present. The backend modules for handling core logic (ingestion, retrieval, generation, vector store interaction) are also in place. However, some specific sub-features or options mentioned in the documentation might be partially implemented, speculative, or require further verification by examining the component/module code directly.

## Feature Implementation Status

Here's a breakdown by feature:

**1. Chat**

*   **Status:** Likely Fully Implemented
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Frontend: `App.tsx` includes navigation to `Chat.tsx`. `Chat.tsx` exists and is substantial (1000+ lines).
    *   Backend: `/chat` endpoints (POST/GET) are defined in `app.py` and handle streaming/non-streaming.
    *   Backend: `ChatRequest` model supports query, `filename`, `knowledge_only`, `use_web`, `stream`, `model`, `provider` parameters.
    *   Backend: `chat_with_knowledge` function is imported and used.
*   **Notes:** The exact UI implementation for all options (model selection, toggles for web/knowledge, file filter) within `Chat.tsx` was not directly viewed but backend support exists.

**2. Document Management**

*   **Status:** Likely Fully Implemented
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Frontend: `App.tsx` includes navigation to `DocumentManager.tsx`. `DocumentManager.tsx` exists.
    *   Backend: `/upload` (POST), `/list` (GET), `/delete/{filename}` (DELETE) endpoints are defined in `app.py`.
    *   Backend: These endpoints utilize functions from `ingestion` and `vector_store` modules (`upload_document`, `delete_document`).
*   **Notes:** The user guide mentions potential "View" and "Edit Metadata" actions per document. While listing and deletion are confirmed via API endpoints, the implementation details of view/edit within `DocumentManager.tsx` would need closer inspection.

**3. Presentations**

*   **Status:** Likely Fully Implemented
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Frontend: `App.tsx` includes navigation to `PresentationViewer.tsx`. `PresentationViewer.tsx` exists.
    *   Backend: `/presentation` (POST) endpoint is defined in `app.py`.
    *   Backend: `PresentationRequest` model exists, supporting prompt, filename, slide count, model, provider.
    *   Backend: `create_presentation` function is imported and used.
*   **Notes:** Specific UI for options (slide count, source doc filter) within `PresentationViewer.tsx` wasn't viewed, but backend support exists.

**4. Research**

*   **Status:** Likely Fully Implemented
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Frontend: `App.tsx` includes navigation to `ResearchReport.tsx`. `ResearchReport.tsx` exists.
    *   Backend: `/research` (POST) endpoint is defined in `app.py`.
    *   Backend: `ResearchRequest` model exists, supporting query and `use_web` flag.
    *   Backend: `create_research_report` function is imported and used.
*   **Notes:** The documentation mentions the *potential* use of `crewai` based on dependencies. The actual usage within `modules/research/research.py` was not verified.

**5. Configuration**

*   **Status:** Likely Fully Implemented (GET endpoint), Partially Implemented/Needs Verification (POST/Editing)
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Frontend: `App.tsx` includes navigation to `Config.tsx`. `Config.tsx` exists.
    *   Backend: `/config` (GET, POST) endpoints are defined.
    *   Backend: `/providers/*` endpoints (Ollama status/load, OpenAI models) are defined.
    *   Backend: Central `CONFIG` object from `modules/config` is used.
*   **Notes:** The GET functionality (viewing config) is likely working. The POST functionality (updating config) exists in the API, but whether the frontend `Config.tsx` component implements the UI for editing and calling this endpoint needs verification.

**6. Supporting Elements**

*   **UI/Styling (`@tremor/react`, CSS Modules):** Implemented. Dependencies and CSS files exist.
*   **API Communication (`axios`):** Implemented. Dependency exists.
*   **Frontend Components (`ModelSelector`, `KnowledgeFilter`):** Partially Implemented/Unclear Usage. Files exist, but their specific integration/use within the main feature components (`Chat`, `DocumentManager`, etc.) was not verified.
*   **Backend Modules (Core Logic):** Implemented (at module level). Directories (`embedding`, `retrieval`, `vector_store`, `ingestion`, `generation`, `config`) exist, and key functions are imported/used in `app.py`.
*   **Backend Services (`backend/src/api/services/`):** Not Implemented / Unused. Directory exists but appears empty.
*   **Storage (`Minio`/Local):** Partially Implemented / Needs Review. `minio` dependency and `storage/` dir exist. Backend code (`app.py`) has commented-out local storage paths, suggesting Minio is intended. The `/get_pdf/{filename}` endpoint seems configured for local storage and might be non-functional or require pointing to Minio.

## Areas Needing Further Review/Clarification

*   **Frontend Component Details:** While core components exist, the specific implementation of all UI elements and options described in the user guide (e.g., model selectors within Chat/Presentation, config editing UI, document view/edit actions) requires reviewing the individual `.tsx` files.
*   **`KnowledgeFilter.tsx` Usage:** How and where this component is used needs clarification.
*   **`crewai` Integration:** Confirm if and how `crewai` is actually used in the research module (`backend/src/modules/research/research.py`).
*   **Storage Configuration:** Clarify whether Minio is fully configured and used, and update/fix the `/get_pdf/{filename}` endpoint if PDF serving is required.
*   **`backend/src/api/services/`:** Confirm if this directory is intended for future use or can be removed.
*   **Error Handling:** Review robustness of error handling in both frontend components and backend API handlers.
*   **Testing:** Check the coverage and effectiveness of existing tests (`frontend/src/App.test.tsx`, `backend/tests/`).
